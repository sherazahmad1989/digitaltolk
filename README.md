BookingController

Use Dependency Injection in the Controller's Constructor:

Instead of accessing env() directly in your controller, it's better to use dependency injection. You can inject the configuration directly into the constructor.

Use Laravel Built-in Response Macros:
Laravel provides a nice way to create custom response macros. Consider using it for consistent and readable response creation.

Use Eloquent to Update Records:
Instead of manually creating SQL queries for updates, leverage Laravel's Eloquent to update records.

Use Request Validation:
Implement request validation for the store and update methods to ensure that only valid data is processed.

Refactor Conditional Statements:
Refactor complex conditional statements to make the code more readable.

Use Dependency Injection for Repository:
Consider using dependency injection for the repository to make it more testable.

1. i have only updated half part of this file cause its improvement taking much time.
2. One more suggession is that we need to breaking larage mehtods into smaller methods for better readibility.
3. i have also add comments on the bottom of each method where you will find the detail of improvement made.

Use Dependency Injection:
Instead of instantiating the Logger and MailerInterface inside the constructor, consider injecting them as dependencies. This makes the class more flexible and allows for easier testing.

Use Short Array Syntax:
Consider using short array syntax ([] instead of array()) for better readability.

Consistent Variable Naming:
Ensure consistent variable naming conventions throughout the code. For example, use either camelCase or snake_case consistently.

Reduce Nesting:
In the getUsersJobs method, the nested if statements could be simplified to reduce nesting.

Avoid Direct Property Access:
Instead of accessing properties directly, consider using getter methods if available.

Separate Concerns:
If possible, try to separate concerns and create smaller methods that handle specific tasks. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand.

Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling mechanisms, especially when dealing with external dependencies like the database or external services.

Comments:
Add comments to explain complex logic or to provide information about the purpose of certain code blocks.
